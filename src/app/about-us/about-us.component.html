<h4>Tyler came from humble origins from a small fishing village in northern Chattanooga.<br>
After having to flee the country due to a failed multi-level marketing scheme,<br>
Tyler discovered his epicureal talents at a young age in Tegucigalpa.<br>
As Tyler began to develop an artisan-like pride in baking pies,<br>
he realized that one pie was never enough and the desire for new knowledge about pie recipies grew.<br>
This eventually led to the natural conclusion of planting various seeds in the ground to try new and exciting pie
varieties.<br>
As these plants grew, so did his new garden. It was then that Tyler realized his destiny and true calling in life -<br>
selling various plants at affordable prices and passing the savings onto the consumer.<br>
And thus, WEBSITE NAME HERE 's online storefront was born.<br>
  Here, you will have access to an incredible variety of plants from Tyler's Garden - some edible,<br>
  others decidedly not - imported directly from beautiful Honduras and smuggled past customs directly to the United<br>
  States.<br>
  We hope you enjoy your stay.</h4>
