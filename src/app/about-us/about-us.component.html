<h4>Tyler came from humble origins from a small fishing village in northern Chattanooga.
After having to flee the country due to a failed multi-level marketing scheme, Tyler discovered his epicureal talents at a young age in Tegucigalpa. As Tyler began to develop an artisan-like pride in baking pies,
he realized that one pie was never enough and the desire for new knowledge about pie recipies grew. This eventually led to the natural conclusion of planting various seeds in the ground to try new and exciting pie varieties. Tyler was then approached by the Tegucigalpain Mafia and given an offer he couldn't refuse.<br>
<br></h4>


<h4>As these plants grew, so too did his new enterprise, and Tyler climbed through the ranks of the underground crime gardening syndicate quickly. It was then that Tyler realized his destiny and true calling in life - selling various plants on the black market at affordable prices and passing the savings onto the consumer. And thus, the Piefather was born. Here, on the Honduran Gardening Black Market, you will have access to an incredible variety of plants from Tyler's Garden - some edible, others decidedly not - imported directly from beautiful Honduras and smuggled past customs directly into the United States.<br>
  We hope you enjoy your stay.</h4>
